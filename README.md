# Spacial Dogfight (working title)

This is a game project we're working on NeMeGitePas (Mando) and I based on one of his ideas.

The game is a melting-pot of features we like in different space game such as :
* Dogfight ! Dogfight ! Dogfight ? DOGFIGHT !
* Cooperative ship control
* Ship against ship fight
* Ship customization & improvement
* Ship boarding and gunfights
* Space exploration

This is a long-running project that just has started.

We don't even have a prototype, only some early game concepts

So keep tune for further developments !

## Plateform & requirements

Made with [Unity 5.6.0f3](https://store.unity.com/download/thank-you?thank-you=personal&os=win&nid=222)

As for now, there's no build, so you need Unity to test the game.

I'll see for a way to share stable builds one day.
