# Spacial Dogfight (working title)

This is a game project we're working on with NeMeGitePas (Mando) and I based on one of his ideas.

The game is a melting-pot of features we like in different space game such as :
* Dogfight ! Dogfight ! Dogfight ? DOGFIGHT !
* Cooperative ship control
* Ship against ship fight
* Ship customization & improvement
* Ship boarding and gunfights
* Space exploration

This is a long-running project that just has started.

We don't even have a prototype, only some early game concepts

So keep tune for further developments !
